I have completed all the requirements for this lab. The UML diagram is also included with the project folder. I used eclipse to complete the code and have zipped the entire project folder.
 

The System prints the output to both the console and the File named "output.txt". This output file resides in the same directory as all the java files. 

For the input: The input file should be present in the same directory as all the java files. System will prompt the user to input the name of the file in the console. For simplicity, I have included the text file for input named TextFile.txt in the project.

To run: Simply import this project to eclipse and run the file with main function.

Note: Minimal input validations performed as not asked as the part of the lab.
