Lab 3

All the requirement for the lab is met by the program.
To run the program simply import the project into eclipse and run the main function in the Client.java file. 
The program uses all three visitors to print the information squentially to the console. 
Three visitors are defined to perform three separate tasks.
Also, the composite pattern is used as intended.
The UML for the program is attached with the project.
