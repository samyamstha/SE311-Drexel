It can be clearly viewed in the attached UML diagram and the component diagram.

To run: First unzip and import both the client project and the server project to eclipse. Then, run the server file first. After that, run the MainDriver.java file in the client project to run the client project. The calculator GUI should appear. You may interact with the calculator GUI and perform the acceptance tests. 

Server output: Successful operation/expressions are sent to the server and the server prints them out to ther console where the server is running.
