Ss4674 - Assignment 1 - SE311

I have completed all the requirements of the Assignment 1 for the class. 
The program is capable of performing IO operation both through the console and the file, depending on the choice of the user. 

To run: Simply unzip the submitted folder and import the eclipse project to the eclipse IDE. The file with the main method is called MasterControl.java. Run the main function to run the program. 

Input/Output Configuration: After the program is run, it will prompt the user to configure the IO method. The user simply needs to enter the correct option to either use the console or file for IO.

Files Path/Placement: The input file must be present in the files directory that is created within the project. Moreover, the user will be prompted to enter the file name if the input for the program is configured to be done via file. Also, the output file is hardcoded and is named "output.txt". Thus, the printed output can be seen in this file, and this file is also present within the same directory as the input file. 
There is an example file for both input (sample.txt) and output (output.txt)

Lastly, appropriate use of oop design is done including proper inheritance, aggregation and the strategy pattern. This can easily be viewed in the uml diagram that is attached in the form of a pdf.
