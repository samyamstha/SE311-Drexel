The program works as required for the Assignment 2.

The program takes the location for uppercase converter and the name of the file for output as the arguments. 

To provide the arguments: The program is written using eclipse, so please use the run configurations window in eclipse to provide the arguments to the Main function. The format would be <location> <fileName>.
I did not make the input file to be passed as the argument since the user can choose to input using the file or the console. Also, this decision was made after consulting with the professor. 

To run the program: Run the MasterControl.java file with run configurations, where you will be providing the arguments required by the program, as mentioned above. Please note that the output file and the input file should be present in the files directory that is within the project.

The output: Output will be written to the file with the provided file name, and will be placed in the files directory that is within the project folder. In case the file is not present the file with that name will be created and the output will be written to it. 

Please feel free to contact me incase there is a problem with running the program.
